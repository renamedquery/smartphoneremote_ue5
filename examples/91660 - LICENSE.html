It is meant to be used in a game where you want a lot of them, like a mob squadron. Flying model, no landing gear. It is UV unwrapped. One texture (2048 x 2048). The file size would only be 505kb if not for the texture.</blockquote><hr /><h3>Help us moderate this file</h3><p>Blend Swap is a place to share and get awesome 3D work, if you think this blend falls into one of the following issues please file a report from <a href="http://www.blendswap.com/blends/view/91660">http://www.blendswap.com/blends/view/91660</a> by clicking on the <strong>Manage</strong> panel to the left of the blend and then on <strong>Report/Flag</strong>:</p><ul><li>The blend author didn't make this blend and posted it as their own.</li><li>The blend author is violating a Creative Commons License or copyright.</li><li>The blend is incomplete, work in progress, or has missing textures.</li><li>The blend contains simulation cache files and other unneeded media.</li><li>The preview image has nothing to do with the blend's contents.</li></ul><p>Your help allows the site to stay clear of broken and stolen work.</p><hr /><h4>Notes:</h4><ul><li>Do NOT report this blend if you dont' know how to use a feature on Blender, instead use the <a href="http://www.blendswap.com/questions">questions section</a> of the site.</li></ul>    </article>    <footer>        Original file hosted by <a href="https://www.blendswap.com">Blend Swap, LLC</a>.    </footer></body></html>
